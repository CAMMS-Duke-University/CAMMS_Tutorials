    "# Getting Started with STM32MP15 Microprocessor\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to start up a STM32MP157x-DKx for the first time\n",
    "\n",
    "![stm32-0](images/stm32-0.jpg \"stm32-0\")\n",
    "\n",
    "STM32MP15 Microprocessor needs an Operating System in order to function. In order to boot an Operating System we need two types of programs, first, the STM32CubeProgrammer tool which is used to flash the STM32MP15 Microprocessor, and an image of the Operating System that will run to the STM32MP15 Microprocessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 0: Format MicroSSD\n",
    "\n",
    "Format of the microSSD before installation is important in case you have an already bootable Operational System inside the microSSD. Because you may see a successful flashing, but when you start the device for the first time after the flashing you completed the OS will not work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Installing the STM32CubeProgrammer software tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we need Software that will boot an Operating System to the STM32MP15 Microprocessor. \n",
    "\n",
    "![stm32-1](images/stm32-1.jpg \"stm32-1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "From the following STM32CubeProg website: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html download the latest software on your Host Computer. As **Host Computer** for the purposes of the STM32MP15 Microprocessor we name the computer which we will connect with your STM32MP15 Microprocessor and communicate via this computer to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "![stm32-2](images/stm32-2.jpg \"stm32-2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then go to this ```zip``` file you downloaded and uncompress it in order to get the STM32CubeProgrammer installers (it doesn’t matter where you save this folder, in the next step you will select in which folder, in particular, this STM32CubeProgrammer will be installed). \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal in this directory and execute the Linux installer which the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$>  ./SetupSTM32CubeProgrammer-2.11.0.linux (or with suffix with the most updated version).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A pop-up Window will appear, and you have to follow the 8 Steps that appear, in order to install the STM32CubeProgrammer. In Step 4 of this installation Window, you have to keep this path that appears, and we name this path as **STM32CubeProgrammer install directory**, so as to use it later in the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![stm32-3](images/stm32-3.jpg \"stm32-3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in Step 5 of this installation Window select all the packages and in Step 7 of this installation Window give permission to all users. The installation after that is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "![stm32-4](images/stm32-4.jpg \"stm32-4\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now after the STM32CubeProgrammer installation, the path to the STM32CubeProgrammer binary must be added to the PATH environment variable, using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export PATH=\"$PATH:YOUR_STM32CubeProgrammer_DIRECTORY/bin\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important NOTES**: \n",
    "- Do not forget the ```/bin``` at the end, the ```STM32CubeProgrammer``` executable is in the ```/bin``` folder.\n",
    "- every command you will execute for this installation should take place in the same terminal. The above command which add to the PATH the directory is temporal not global\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the **my STM32CubeProgrammer install directory** is the path we kept above. Important: the path has to lead to the STM32CubeProgrammer, not the external directory, for example in our case the ```YOUR_STM32CubeProgrammer_DIRECTORY``` path that leads to the STM32CubeProgrammer is as follows:\n",
    "```/usr/local/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube/STM32CubeProgrammer``` \n",
    "\n",
    "So now you are ready to open the ```STM32CubeProgrammer```. Just write in the terminal ```STM32CubeProgrammer``` and the application will open. Close the application, we will use it later.\n",

    "# Step 2: Preparing the USB serial link for flashing and giving Permissions \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to install a package that provides generic access to USB devices, usually, it’s already installed in the Host Computer, but better to check it. It is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the production of applications that communicate with USB hardware: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$>  sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0\n",

    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$>  sudo apt-get install libusb-*\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Then to allow STM32CubeProgrammer to access the USB port through low-level commands, proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$>   cd <your STM32CubeProgrammer install directory>/Drivers/rules \n",
    "$>   sudo cp *.* /etc/udev/rules.d/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that the automated permissions do not work you may give permission manually by going to the  following directory ```/etc/udev/rules.d``` and adding a new rule: ```sudo vim 97-perm-stm32mp15.rules``` and in this file add the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"device_idVendor\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"device_idProduct\", GROUP=\"root\", MODE=\"777\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to insert the ```device_idProduct``` value and ```device_idVendor``` value of your device STM32MP15 Microprocessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Downloading the image and flashing it on the board\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to download the Operation-System image which will be installed in the STM32MP15 Microprocessor. This Operation-System image will be installed in the microSSD. The STM32MP1 image (binaries) is delivered through one tarball file named: https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32mp1starter.html#get-software/FLASH-stm32mp1-openstlinux-5.15-yocto-kirkstone-mp1-v22.06.15.tar.xz \n",
